# Starting Line

Welcome to the Rise of the Machines.

# Session Description

## Communicating with the Rise of the Machines

An estimated 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet over the next 5 years. Many of these devices will be generating petabytes of sensor data.  Businesses can use this data to apply machine learning principles and techniques to increase revenue, reduce expenses, and even improve safety. However, machine learning requires human feedback to teach machines expected behaviors. In this session, Peter DeMartini will talk about how Octoblu can bridge the gap between people and machines.

# Talking Points

- What is the Internet of Things?
  - devices and machines working together to make your life better
  - Kevin Ashton said “The Internet of Things has the potential to change the world, just as the internet did. Maybe even more so.”
  - smart offices, cars, homes, wearables, and cities
    - wemo, hue, lifx, nest, drone, chromecast, amazon echo, lockitron, apple watch, moto 360, fitbit, myo
    - the amount of these types of devices are growing at incredible rate.
  - device intelligence
    - devices that know what you want before you want it
    - when you walk into a room, turn the lights on
    - when you go on a trip, turn off the thermostat
    - when you walk into the office turn the tv on, turn lights on, notify those involved
    - when your vital signs are showing issues, schedule an appointment with your doctor or notify a response unit
  - a network of physical and virtual things
    - everything connected everything
    - the become a intelligent, automated machine
  - growth and analytics
    - everything will become connected to the internet
    - big data and I mean big data
    - realtime view into the inner-workings of the machines
  - automation
    - everything that can be repeated will be automated
  - IoT, will be the next industrial revolution. Billions of dollars will be saved, trillions will be made.
  - IoT is at an experimental phase, just as the internet was in the 90s.
- Metrics
  - Today: 1.9B connected devices. 50B estimated by 2020.
    - only 5 years away
    - there will be 8x more internet connected devices than people in the world.
  - By 2020, the IoT market value is predicted to be between $3T and $14T
    - whether you want it or not, it is coming
- How IoT affects business communication
  - machine automation
    - Robert Cannon said “Everything that can be automated, will be automated.”
    - machines work 24/7
    - machines are cheap
  - human interaction
    - humans will be the source of creativity and personality, machines will handle the rest
  - machine learning
    - anomaly detection
    - event prediction
    - context aware systems
  - it is about the experience
- How Octoblu helps solve this problem
  - a platform, or operating system, designed to orchestrate internet connected devices and services
  - connecting everything to everything
  - talking to devices and services is hard, and often point to point, we make it easy.
  - automation
    - using our designer to create a visual representation of flows
  - security
  - analyze
    - interactions directly with the data
  - flexibility
    - allows you build anything easily. From automated workflow to programing microcontrollers and robots
  - community
    - 80% of our platform is opensource
    - we have roughly 240 opensource repositories
    - meshblu
- How Twilio helps solve this problem
  - a simple and intelligent interface into communications such as sms, mms, and voice
  - a practical implementation of simple support calls, notifications and two-way interactions that can be context aware and automated
  - Twilio is a first class citizen in Octoblu, meaning integrations are seamless.
    - communicate with ease
  - examples of support automation
    - when a customer responds badly
    - build a notification system, enabling devices and people to talk together
    - an interactive texting conversation, integrating different services, responding to your customer without writing code.
- Lessons Learned
  - be lazy, automate everything that you can
    - Bill Gates said "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it."
  - microservices
    - complex applications composed in small pieces.
  - machines cost very little and will only get cheaper and faster, so use them
  - make the world a better place
    - make it easier and better for people
    - strive for a better world
  - let humans do what they do best
    - be personal
    - be smart
    - be creative
  - we work as a team at octoblu. We believe that people create better things when working side by side and interacting directly with users.
- Impact
  - save man hours through automation and intelligent workflow
  - secure and personal interactions between humans and machines
    - the internet of things will diminish if it is secure.
    - people need the right kind of privacy
  - with the power of IoT, we can focus on making the world a better place
  - smart devices will not only save time but save lives
    - uberemt
    - smarter police, being view the world through sensors and make the best, safest decision
