# Session Description

## Communicating with the Rise of the Machines

An estimated 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet over the next 5 years. Many of these devices will be generating petabytes of sensor data.  Businesses can use this data to apply machine learning principles and techniques to increase revenue, reduce expenses, and even improve safety. However, machine learning requires human feedback to teach machines expected behaviors. In this session, Peter DeMartini will talk about how Octoblu can bridge the gap between people and machines.
