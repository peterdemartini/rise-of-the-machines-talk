# Session Description

## Communicating with the Rise of the Machines

An estimated 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet over the next 5 years. Many of these devices will be generating petabytes of sensor data.  Businesses can use this data to apply machine learning principles and techniques to increase revenue, reduce expenses, and even improve safety. However, machine learning requires human feedback to teach machines expected behaviors. In this session, Peter DeMartini will talk about how Octoblu can bridge the gap between people and machines.

# Talking Points

- **[!!!]** Welcome to the Rise of the Machines.

- **[!!!]** **What is the Internet of Things?**
  - devices, services and people working together to make the world better
  - **[!!!]** smart offices, cars, homes, wearables, and cities
    - some of the popular devices are:
    - hue light bulbs
    - nest, an internet connect thermostat
    - amazon echo, a personal information and home automation hub
    - wearables such as the apple watch, moto 360, fitbit, and myo
    - the amount of these types of devices are growing at incredible rate.
  - **[!!!]** The MIT pioneer, Kevin Ashton, who is said to be the father of IoT, said “The Internet of Things has the potential to change the world, just as the internet did. Maybe even more so.”
  - device intelligence
    - devices that know what you want before you want it
    - a few examples could be:
    - when you walk into a room, turn the hue lights on
    - when the temperature becomes cold outside, adjust the thermostat, and send notify me
    - when you walk into the conference room, turn lights on, put my presentation on the screen, notify my late coworkers
    - when your vital signs are showing issues, schedule an appointment with your doctor or notify a response unit
  - a network of physical and virtual things
  - automation
    - IoT is about making things more efficient and automation plays a huge roll in that
    - Webster Dictionary defines automation to be "the technique of making an apparatus, a process, or a system operate automatically"
  - growth and analytics
    - big data and I mean big data, petabytes of information transmitted
    - realtime view into the inner-workings of the machines
  - IoT, will be the next industrial revolution. Billions of dollars will be saved, trillions will be made.
- **[!!!]** **Metrics**
  - **[!!!]** Today: 1.9B connected devices. 50B estimated by 2020.
    - Ericsson President and CEO Hans Vestberg
    - only 5 years away
    - there will be 8x more internet connected devices than people in the world.
  - **[!!!]** By 2020, the IoT market value is predicted to be between $3T and $14T
    - says IoT analysts
    - whether you want it or not, it is coming
  - **[!!!]** if IoT improved efficiency by %1, over $276B would be saved
- **[!!!]** **How IoT affects business communication**
  - it is about the experience
  - **[!!!]** Robert Cannon, an internet law and policy expert, says “Everything that can be automated, will be automated.”
  - **[!!!]** machine automation
    - because machines work 24/7 and are getting cheaper and faster
  - **[!!!]** machine learning
    - anomaly detection
    - event prediction
    - context aware systems
  - **[!!!]** human interaction
    - humans are the source of creativity and personality, but machines can be a great tool
- **[!!!]** **What is Octoblu and how does it solve this problem**
  - a platform, and network of services, designed to orchestrate devices and services
  - citrix CEO, Mark Templeton, calls us the Integration of Everything
  - **[!!!]** talking to devices is hard, and often point to point, we make it easy.
  - **[!!!]** our designer allows you to create a visual representation of flows
  - security
  - analyze
    - interactions directly with the data
  - flexibility
    - allows you build anything easily. From automated workflow to programing microcontrollers, drones and robots
  - community
    - meshblu, M2M messaging platform
    - 80% of our platform is open source
    - we have roughly 240 open source repositories
- **[!!!]** **With the rise of machines how do humans communicate?**
- **[!!!]** **How Twilio helps solve this problem**
  - with the rise of machines how do humans communicate?
  - a simple and intelligent interface into communications such as sms, mms, and voice
  - a practical implementation of simple support calls, notifications and two-way interactions that can be context aware and automated
  - Twilio is a first class citizen in Octoblu, meaning integrations are seamless.
  - examples of support automation
    - when a customer responds badly
    - build a notification system, enabling devices and people to talk together
    - an interactive texting conversation, integrating different services, responding to your customer without writing code.
- **[!!!]** **Impact**
  - save man hours through intelligent systems
  - secure and personal interactions between humans and machines
    - the internet of things will diminish if it is not secure.
  - imagine a secure system where privacy and security is the first priority
  - with the power of IoT, we can focus on making the world a better place
  - smart devices will not only save time but save lives
    - uberemt
    - healthcare integrations
- **[!!!]** **Lessons Learned**
  - **[!!!]** be lazy, automate everything that you can
    - Bill Gates said "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it."
  - **[!!!]** microservices
    - complex applications composed in small pieces.
  - **[!!!]** machines cost very little and will only get cheaper and faster, so use them
  - **[!!!]** make the world a better place
    - make it easier and better for people
    - strive for a better world
  - **[!!!]** let humans do what they do best
    - be personal
    - be smart
    - be creative
  - another thing we learned was automated testing
    - continuous deployment and integration tests
- **[!!!]**
